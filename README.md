### Zero Knowledge Proof Authentication

 In cryptography, a zero-knowledge proof or zero-knowledge protocol is a method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that a given statement is true while the prover avoids conveying any additional information apart from the fact that the statement is indeed true. The essence of zero-knowledge proofs is that it is trivial to prove that one possesses knowledge of certain information by simply revealing it; the challenge is to prove such possession without revealing the information itself or any additional information.
  
 Here, we are using the elliptic curve cryptography to generate the public and private key pair. The public key is used to encrypt the challenge and the private key is used to decrypt the challenge. The challenge is a random string generated by the server. The server will verify the challenge by decrypting the encrypted challenge using the public key. If the decrypted challenge is same as thechallenge generated by the server, then the user is authenticated.
